### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
IÂ´m  Mari, a dressmaker and practical nurse by my earlier educations. 
I have 20 years of experience working in retail, healthcare and importing fields.
In 2020 I decided to quit my job working as a warehouse supervisor and truly commit to following my dreams.

Now I finally have the opportunity and courage to explore the world of coding.

Fall 2020 I started studies in Highway2Code program in Vaasa AMK, with webtechnologies and IoT.
Thus far we have enjoyed courses in HTML & CSS, WordPress, JavaScript, Fundamentals of AI and Introduction to programming (React).
  (Jan - May 2021 we will study PHP & MySql, Cyber Security, software engineering project and do some practical training.)

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also currently learning https://www.freecodecamp.org/marijsin , 
some Udemy courses (atmo Colt SteeleÂ´s ,Andrei NeagoieÂ´s  and Angela YuÂ´s) and Wes BosÂ´s https://javascript30.com
