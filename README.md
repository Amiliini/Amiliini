### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
IÂ´m  Mari, a dressmaker and practical nurse by my earlier educations. 
I have 20 years of experience working in retail, healthcare and importing fields.
In 2020 I decided to quit my job working as a warehouse supervisor and truly commit to following my dreams.

Now I finally have the opportunity and courage to explore the world of coding.

Fall 2020 I started studies in Highway2Code program in Vaasa AMK, with webtechnologies and IoT.
Thus far we have enjoyed courses in HTML & CSS, WordPress, JavaScript, Fundamentals of AI,
Introduction to programming (React),PHP & MySql and Cyber Security.
Next month or so we have software engineering project and practical training left. 
So pretty soon IÂ´ll be back to my onlinelearning and doing projects on my own.

Plan is to start the Full Stack open 2021 in May.
