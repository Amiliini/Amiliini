### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
IÂ´m  Mari, a dressmaker and practical nurse by my earlier educations. 
I have 20 years of experience working in retail, healthcare and importing fields.

In 2020 I decided to quit my job working as a warehouse supervisor and truly commit (pun intented) to follow my dreams.

Now I finally have the opportunity and courage to explore the world of coding!

May 2021 I finished studies in Highway2Code program in Vaasa AMK, with studies in webtechnologies and IoT.
The courses were: HTML & CSS, WordPress, JavaScript, Fundamentals of AI,
Introduction to programming (React),PHP & MySql and Cyber Security, Software engineering project (video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui23eTP56Uc ) and practical training. 

Now IÂ´m learning new skills on FullStack rekrykoulutus with Opiframe.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about sourdough IÂ´ve been baking loads of breads. âœŒðŸ’š
