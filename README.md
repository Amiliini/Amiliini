### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
IÂ´m a dressmaker and practical nurse by my earlier educations. 
I have 20 years of experience working in retail, healthcare and importing fields.
In 2020 I decided to quit my job working as a supervisor and truly commit to following my dreams.

Now I finally have the opportunity and courage to explore the world of coding..

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning https://www.freecodecamp.org/marijsin , 
some Udemy courses (atmo Colt SteeleÂ´s ,Andrei NeagoieÂ´s  and Angela YuÂ´s) and Wes BosÂ´s https://javascript30.com

This fall IÂ´m starting studies in Highway2Code program in Vaasa AMK, with webtechnologies and IoT.

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about sourdough IÂ´ve been baking loads of breads. âœŒğŸ’š
